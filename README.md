# ðŸ“™ crustimoney

A Clojure library for PEG parsing, supporting various grammars, packrat caching and cuts.

![Banner](banner.png)

## Motivation

Version 1 of crustimoney was my first library in Clojure, a long time ago.
Simply put, this version is the mental excercise of making it better.
I like to think it turned out well.
Maybe you like it too.

## Features

- Create parsers from **combinator** functions
- .. or from **string-based** definitions
- .. or from **data-driven** definitions
- Packrat **caching**, optimizing cpu usage
- Concept of **cuts**, optimizing memory usage - and error messages
- Focus on capture groups, resulting in **lean parse trees**, less coupled to grammar structure
- **Minimal parse tree** data, fetch only whats needed at post-processing
- Virtual stack, preventing stack overflows
- Infinite **loop detection** (runtime)
- Missing rule references detection (compile time)

## Usage
