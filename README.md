# ðŸ“™ crustimoney

A Clojure library for PEG parsing, supporting various grammars, packrat caching and cuts.

![Banner](banner.png)

## Motivation

Version 1 of crustimoney was my first library in Clojure, a long time ago.
Simply put, this version is the mental excercise of making it better.
I like to think it turned out well.
Maybe you like it too.

## Features

- Create parsers from **combinator** functions
- .. or from **string-based** definitions
- .. or from **data-driven** definitions
- Packrat **caching**, optimizing cpu usage
- Concept of **cuts**, optimizing memory usage - and error messages
- Focus on capture groups, resulting in **lean parse trees**, less coupled to grammar structure
- **Minimal parse tree** data, fetch only whats needed at post-processing
- Virtual stack, preventing stack overflows
- Infinite **loop detection** (runtime)
- Missing rule references detection (compile time)

## Usage

First, add this library to your dependencies.
The instructions for the latest version can be found here: [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/functionalbytes/crustimoney.svg)](https://clojars.org/functionalbytes/crustimoney)

### The combinators

The combinators are at the heart of the library.
Even if you decide to never use them directly, it is a good starting point.
Below is a list of available combinators.

The essentials:

- `literal`, match an exact literal string
- `chain`, chain multiple consecutive parsers
- `choice`, match the first successful parsers
- `repeat*`, eagerly match a parser as many times as possible
- `negate`, succeed of the given parser does not

Those are actually enough for parsing any PEG-parseable text
But more combinators are provided.
For ease of use, nicer result trees and better performance:

- `regex`, match a regular expression
- `repeat+`, eagerly match a parser as many times as possible, require at least one match
- `lookahead`, succeed if the given parser does, without advancing
- `maybe`, try the given parser, succeed anyway
- `eof`, succeed if there is no more input

Each combinator returns a parser.
Some combinators take one or more parsers, making them composable.

Such a parser can be supplied to `core/parse`, together with the string to parse.

### Parse results

The result is a "hiccup"-style parse tree, for example:

```clj
[:node {:start 0, :end 6}
 [:child-node {:start 0, :end 3}]
 [:child-node {:start 3, :end 6}]]
```

To actually capture a node during parsing, the parser must be "named".
This is done via `combinators/with-name` (or by other means, depending on the grammar type).
Results without a name are filtered out, though its named children are kept.
